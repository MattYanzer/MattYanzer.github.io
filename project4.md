## Project description

This project entails a Python program that calculates the length of a hypotenuse given the length of the other two sides of a hypothetical triangle as well as the surface area of said triangle.

## How to compile / run the program

Navigate to where the folder is located and execute these commands on your terminal.

```bash
./RightTriangle.py
```

## UI Design

As previously stated, this project calculates the hypotenuse of a triangle given the triangle's other two sides. In addition, it calculates the surface area of the triangle.
