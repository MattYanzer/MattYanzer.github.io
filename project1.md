## Project description

This project was made for a fictional marathon run event. The website would allow people to register for the race, join teams for the race, and inform both participants and observers about the event. The website would accommodate cross-platform, so people could comfortably navigate the website on both desktop and mobile device.

## UI Design

People visiting the website would first be greeted with a welcome page to the website (See Figure 1). From there they could either log in to the website or register an account, which would take the user to the pages displayed in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. If a returning user is logging in, they are greeted with the page in Figure 4. Of course, if a user logs in with incorrect information, they are given an error message (See Figure 5). An error message will also be given to users registering for the race if any of their information cannot be used (See Figure 6). If a user is an admin, they can access the list of users registered for the race and have the option of deleting users and promoting users to admins (See Figure 7). There is also a settings page where the user can update their information (See Figure 8). When a new User is created, they are greeting with the information page and a notification welcoming them to the event. Unlike admins, users do not have access to the Users page (See Figure 9). The website is currently supported by heroku and can be visited with the following link. [Here is the website](http://gentle-caverns-07357.herokuapp.com/)
